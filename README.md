# My Book Library Web App

This is a fun project where I'm building a web library to help digitize and rate my own collection of books.

I have absolutely no idea of web development. Expect simple and messy html and css files.

## Features
- Add books to your personal library.
- Rate books with a simple 0-10.
- Basic display of the book collection.

I'm using basic technologies like:
- Python (for the backend)
- Flask (for creating the web app)
- HTML/CSS (to make things look decent-ish)
